First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

## Submitting issues

* If you think you've found an issue, search the issue list to see if there's an existing issue.
* Then, if you find nothing, open a GitHub issue.

## Pull Requests

If your change concern the collection in itself we're more than happy to review your contribution in this repository!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve when submitting your PR:

  * Have a proper commit history (we advise you to rebase if needed).
  * Summarize your PR with an explanatory title and a message describing your changes, cross-referencing any related bugs/PRs.
  * Open your PR against the `master` branch.

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. For instance, if you're fixing a role and at the same time adding some code refactor, it makes reviewing harder and the _time-to-release_ longer.

### Commit messages

Please take a moment to write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been working on for a day.

### Squash your commits

Rebase your changes on `master` and squash your commits whenever possible. This keeps history cleaner and easier to revert things. It also makes developers happier!

## Development

To contribute, follow the contributing guidelines above.
